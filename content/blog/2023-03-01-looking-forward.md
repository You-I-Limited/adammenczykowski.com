# Looking forward

Today on the 3rd January 2023 I return to work feeling moderately enthused about the year to come. That’s not to say I’m not excited. But it is raining outside and the winter weather will be sticking around for a while yet. I can’t wait until the grass isn’t sodden, the guttering has been fixed (I need to get quotes) and that we have something exciting (like a holiday) to look forward to.

Looking forward, I aim to keep up this writing lark. I genuinely feel good about the possibility that I will be able to reflect later this year having kept this up consistently. I hope to discover more about myself and shape my future by doing this.

I suppose publishing this could be a good idea too. I might just do that. I think putting this into my adammenczykowski.com blog could be a great place to do it.

I just went off and googled using the google docs api to power my blog. Could be a good option. It will mean manually adding each document id to a blog post, but not too much work really. Either I do that or I set up statamic. Either option will mean an evening’s worth of work to get it going. I think I already have a nuxt content blog so that might be my first port of call until I can be bothered to build something else. Best to keep it simple eh.

## Just keep writing

My main aspiration in the short term is to keep this  writing up. But I really want to use this skill to grow ideas for my family’s future. Namely coming up with business ideas to work on as side projects. I imagine I’ll have to attempt a number of ideas before anything sticks / becomes even remotely successful. I see success as having a user base of free / paid users using something that I’ve built, ultimately to be earning followers and income without exchanging my time for money.

### A framework for ideas

My current job is as a lead frontend javascript developer & web designer building a large scale internal software application for an IT reseller business. That, along with my experience freelancing as a web developer for the past 8 years or so (not exactly sure when I started this lark) has given me most of the skills that I need to get cracking with a Saas (software as a service) side project.

I’m sure there is a lot that I do not know about! The act of building the product is only a small part of the picture. I am acutely aware that marketing + audience building is arguably more important than software development. I suppose this act of writing regularly is going to help me build an audience, hopefully.

I’m extremely hesitant to just dive in and immediately start building something. The countless hours of reading twitter and watching YouTube has taught me one thing (no, it isn’t that I  am good at procrastinating!) - It is crucial to validate ideas before working on them. So my starting point is to create a list of ideas, each with a small level of exploration. I may use a framework to scaffold out the initial concepts of each idea.

Here is a rough outline of what I could aim to write down of each possible idea:

1. A one sentence summary of what the idea is - use a purely factual explanation here, nothing ‘catchy’
2. A 2-3 paragraph introduction the the idea and its concepts
3. Whether the product would be sold from business to customer (B2C) or business to business (B2B)
4. Business name idea
5. Tagline idea

Using this framework will allow me to build a list and get a feel for what ideas I am capable of generating. Beyond writing a list, I will soon need to begin validating said ideas. I think this is both internal and external. Do I want to work on this? Do I think it is viable? Do I think it adds value? In addition to eternal user research, asking others questions if they think it is viable. Asking people in the related industry what they thing.

### Having started already
I have actually started this process already. I have a list of ideas with a minimal amount of information around each one. In fact, for one of them, an MOT reminder service for garages, my wife and I began phoning around MOT garages to see if they would be interested in using the platform if we were to build it. Much to our dismay all of them came back saying that they already had a solution, or that they weren’t interested in our idea. I think this is a prime example of what we will be faced with in the future: onboarding people and getting them to be interested in our idea. There will be knockbacks no doubt. I am sure that the whole journey of discovering and creating Sass(es) will instil resilience in us (I refer to both myself and my wife).
