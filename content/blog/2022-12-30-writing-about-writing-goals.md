# Writing about writing goals

My writing goals going forward from today, 30th December 2022, are to try to write every day. 10 mins minimum, ideally for about 30 minutes to deeper explore a topic. The subjects that I write about can be anything from business ideas, my personal feelings & aspirations and reflecting on times gone by.

I hope to get a sense of perspective so that when times are harder and I’m struggling to retain a focused outlook, I can be safe in the knowledge that I have consistently been writing, as a way to explore my feelings, put down my ideas and get things off my mind.

This already feels easier than I thought it would. ‘Just do it’ philosophy, without forethought. 

Without second guessing what I’m about to say and just writing I think that there is a subconscious connection between my thoughts and what I am typing. It is something you don’t realise you have until you actually type the first word, then follow that with another and so on.

## Finding inspiration in writing 

Business ideas are something I’ve struggled with over the recent years. I am really keen to have a list of ideas that are potentially viable money making ventures. With persistence in writing, I hope to discover more ideas from my own mind and from researching niches and gaps in the market and where other businesses have already built something but not the way that I would want to do it.

Also reflecting on personal relationships, how I deal with things personally and how my behaviour and actions affect others is something that I hope to improve upon by writing down my thoughts and feelings.

There are a multitude of past experiences that still come back to my thoughts, which if I were to write about, or if I write about those past experiences in the future, could be easier to reason about and lay to rest. I find that subconsciously I am distracted by past experiences and writing could be a great way to finalise my thoughts, or at the very least get them off my chest, to find some peace in my busy mind.

### Reflecting on the now

So I’ve done 10 minutes so far and feel that this comes fairly naturally, with a small amount of pushing myself internally. Free from any expectations I can ‘just write’ and see what happens. I wonder how aimless writing will allow me to find a path. To expose what internal route or guidance I have built into me.

I’m sure through regular consistent writing there will be much to discover. I feel both comfort and excitement in this very practice. My language skills allow me to express myself clearly, however I do sometimes find it difficult to find the exact right words. I think upping my reading to once a day, fiction, non-fiction, articles, newspapers, whatever I’m drawn to will help my vocabulary improve and increase the speed in which I locate the correct word for the situation.
